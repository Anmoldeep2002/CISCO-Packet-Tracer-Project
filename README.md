<h1>Small Office Network Design and Configuration with DHCP and DNS</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project simulates the setup and configuration of a small office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases my ability to configure a DHCP server to assign IP addresses to devices across two different subnets, using a router as a DHCP relay. It also demonstrates my ability to set up DNS for hostname resolution, and manually configure static IP addresses on router interfaces. This configuration is widely used in real-world small and medium-sized organisations to centralize IP address management and ensure scalability.</p>

STEP 1 (CREATING NETWORK DESIGN): <br/>

<p align="center">This is the design I created for my project using Cisco Packet Tracer software. As you can see, the network is made up of one router, two switches, four clients, one access point, and one server. This network design was created for a small office that is divided into two rooms (ROOMS 1 and 2). Each room contains one switch and two clients, with ROOM 1 featuring an "Access Point" for wireless connectivity. The router has been put in the middle to facilitate communication between the two rooms, which are on different subnets. The server handles DHCP and DNS duties, and clients can automatically receive IP addresses from an IP pool. The server will also allow clients to "PING" each other by simply entering the device name rather than an IP address.</p>

STEP 2 (CONNECTING DEVICES): <br/>

<p align="center">The following step was to connect all of the devices and clients together. First, I selected the option to connect the devices, followed by the port to which the device would be connected. The second image shows that all of the devices and clients (with the exception of the laptop) are connected to their appropriate ports via an ethernet cable.</p>
